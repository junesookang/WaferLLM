# MeshGEMM

## Overview

This folder contains the implementation of the **MeshGEMM** algorithm, which computes general matrix multiplication of the form $[M,N]=[M,K]@[K,N]$

## Platform

- **Cerebras SDK version**: 1.4
- **Cerebras ML Software version**: 2.5

## Parameters

- `P`: Number of PEs in each dimension (creates PÃ—P PE grid)
- `M`: Number of rows in the first matrix
- `K`: Shared dimension between matrices
- `N`: Number of columns in the second matrix

## Run with Simulator

The simulator allows you to test and debug your MeshGEMM implementation before deploying to actual hardware.

```bash
# bash ./run_sim.sh P M K N
# Then we run [M, K]@[K, N] on P * P PE cores on cerebras simulator
# Example
bash ./run_sim.sh 64 1024 1024 1024
```

**Note:** The simulator provides cycle-accurate performance estimates and allows debugging without consuming actual hardware resources.

## Run with Cerebras

Deploy and execute your MeshGEMM algorithm on the actual WSE-3 hardware.

```bash
# bash ./run_wse3.sh P M K N [true for simulator | false for real device]
# Then we run [M, K]@[K, N] on P * P PE cores on cerebras chip
# Example
bash ./run_wse3.sh 64 1024 1024 1024 true # For appliance simulator
bash ./run_wse3.sh 64 1024 1024 1024 false # Runing on real WSE-3
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Ensure you have access to a WSE-3 system
- Verify your environment is properly configured with Cerebras SDK
- Check that you have the necessary permissions to run on hardware

**Performance Considerations:**
- The WSE-3 provides massive parallelism with thousands of cores
- Optimal performance is achieved when matrix dimensions are divisible by P
- Consider memory constraints when selecting matrix sizes
